### Free Basic Parallax theme

Parallax_theme is a simple static website with basic parallax effect that you can use for your next project for free. Right now the images are randomly changing based on source.unsplash.com. You can use your own images as required.

### Getting started

From your console (e.g.cmd or GitBash) first clone the repository and enter the app root directory:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/angsherpa232/parallax_theme.git
cd parallax_theme

## Running

If your favourite text-editor is vs-code, installing live-server extension is highly suggested as it auto updates the changes you made in your code.
